A unity game programmer who's right now studying 2nd year of game programming at Futuregames Skellefteå.

<h1>STEEZY</h1>

A snowboarding game me and a group of classmates made in ca 1 month that won the competition the school was holding. It also gained some interrest from investors stationed in Skellefteå. My role in the project was as Backend Programmer so I coded all the UI and also started on a leaderboard before 

Here's a gameplay trailer of the game

            _overheat = baseOverheat + currentStatModifiers.overheatMod;

            _maxAmmo = baseMaxAmmo + currentStatModifiers.maxAmmoMod;
