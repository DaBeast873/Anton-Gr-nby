<h1>STEEZY</h1>

A snowboarding game me and a group of classmates made in ca 1 month that won the competition the school was holding. It also gained some interrest from investors stationed in Skellefteå. My role in the project was as Backend Programmer so I coded all the UI and also started on a leaderboard before

An upgrade system I made for a school project

        private void UpdateGun()
        {
            _damage = baseDamage + currentStatModifiers.damageMod;
            _range = baseRange + currentStatModifiers.rangeMod;
            _overheat = baseOverheat + currentStatModifiers.overheatMod;

            _maxAmmo = baseMaxAmmo + currentStatModifiers.maxAmmoMod;
            _currentAmmo = _maxAmmo;
        }      
```
